- **Eye & Yawn Monitoring** — Calculates EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio) and MAR (Mouth Aspect Ratio) to identify drowsiness or yawning.
- **Audio Alerts** — Plays different sounds when you are distracted, your eyes are closed for too long, or you yawn.
- **Motivational Messages** — Displays motivational prompts at set intervals.
- **Break Reminders** — Notifies you when it’s time to take a break after long study sessions.
